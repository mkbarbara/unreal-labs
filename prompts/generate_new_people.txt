You are tasked with generating new person descriptions based on a transformation theme.

Original people count: {num_people}
Transformation theme: {transformation_theme}

Original people detected in video:
{original_people}

Your task:
1. Analyze the transformation theme to understand what type of people should be generated
2. Generate exactly {num_people} NEW person descriptions that match the transformation theme
3. Consider the context:
   - If theme mentions "couple", generate appropriate genders (e.g., man and woman, or as specified)
   - If theme mentions specific demographic (e.g., "Black people", "Asian people"), ensure all generated people match
   - If theme mentions an age group (e.g., "elderly", "young"), ensure all generated people match
4. Each person should have: gender, age, skin, hair, clothing
5. Make descriptions diverse and realistic within the theme constraints

Return ONLY raw valid JSON with no code fences, no markdown, no explanations in this exact format:
{{
  "people": [
    {{
      "person_id": "person_1",
      "gender": "male or female",
      "age": "child, teenager, young_adult, adult, middle_aged, or elderly",
      "skin": "very light, light, medium, tan, brown, or deep",
      "hair": "detailed hair description including color, length, and style",
      "clothing": "detailed clothing description"
    }}
  ]
}}

Examples:
- Theme "Black people couple" with 2 original people → Generate 1 Black woman + 1 Black man
- Theme "Asian elderly people" with 3 original people → Generate 3 Asian elderly people (mixed genders)
- Theme "Young Black professionals" with 2 original people → Generate 2 young Black adults in professional attire
