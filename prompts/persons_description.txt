You are analyzing a video and need to identify unique individuals across multiple frames.

Here is the detection data from sampled frames:
{frame_analyses}

Your task:
1. Identify unique individuals that appear across frames (the same person may have different temp_ids in different frames)
2. For each unique person, create a consolidated profile with their most consistent attributes
3. Assign each person a consistent ID (person_1, person_2, etc.)

Return ONLY raw valid JSON with no code fences, no markdown, no explanations in this exact format:
{{
  "people": [
    {{
      "person_id": "person_1",
      "gender": "female",
      "age": "adult",
      "skin": "medium",
      "hair": "consolidated hair description",
      "clothing": "consolidated clothing description",
    }}
  ]
